I am currently studying  Bachelor's Degree program in Computer Science  at Kazakh-British Technical  University known with its ACM ICPC contestans.  I am  very thankful that I am studying right here and very happy that I chose this area of study.  From the first year of the study I am  always looking for  opportunities, especially  opportunities which will help me to be better and better  professional .  So,  in the last year  I participated in  Technovation (https://technovationchallenge.org/) which helped me to know my skills.  In our team for this project  I was designer and did  prototypes,  design of our app and etc. Shortly, it  was really great  experience.  Also,this year I am working as an assistant  of professor in class called "Programming Principles" for freshmen.   Like I already said I am interesting in sport programming and already our team participated in most of competions.  In my opinion, my main advantage  is in learning everythins faster!
